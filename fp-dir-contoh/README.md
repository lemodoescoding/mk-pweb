### Custom Routing using PHP

---

- Built with PHP and Using MVC Design
- Note that, the App is only support GET and POST request
- the entry of the app is on `public/index.php`
- you can add routes as many as you like
- the route accept a callback, or an array containing name of a class and the method
- i've installed `dotenv` dependency to load env variables from the `.env` variable, i've provided `.env.example` file, and you can replace it with `.env` file and fill the data, or modify the file
- make sure when you run the app, the host is pointing to `public/index.php`, otherwise it will cause some issue

- Note: Feel free to say, that you can improve this App more better
- you can add other dependencies, or other things to the app
